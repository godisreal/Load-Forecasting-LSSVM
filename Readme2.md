Verification of Extended Finite State Machines from Control Perspective

Some Examples are investigated


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some Notes: 
Load Forecasting by Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM). 

The result is compared with traditional Neural Network Method.  
The Similar Day Approach is applied with LSSVM and Neural Network
