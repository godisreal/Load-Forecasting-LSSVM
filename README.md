# Verification of Extended Finite State Machines from Control Perspective
Some Examples are investigated

# Load Forecasting by Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM)
The result is compared with traditional Neural Network Method.  
The Similar Day Approach is applied with LSSVM and Neural Network
