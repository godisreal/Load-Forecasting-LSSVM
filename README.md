# Verification of Extended Finite State Machines from Control Perspective

Some Examples are investigated in the background of computer science.  

This brief report discusses verification problem of extended Finite state machines in the background of computer science.  The problem is related to the traditional supervisory control theory (SCT) of discrete event systems, but the difference exists in using variables to reduce the computational complexity and implement the control. 

In particular we will use the variables and predicates to implement the supervior in SCT theory. With the variables and predicates the new model functions like extended finite state machines (EFSM), which is more practical in the engineering field, especially in computer programs.
